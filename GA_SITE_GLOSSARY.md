# Public   Water Supply Systems Search Parameters

Drinking Water Watch (DWW) allows state
drinking water administrators, laboratories, and the public to access
drinking water information under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).
It can be deployed on the World Wide Web outside a state's electronic
firewall and does not require sign-in authentication for access. The database
from which DWW retrieves its information is a static copy of the state’s
custodial drinking water database, which is refreshed at the state’s discretion.

This search page lets you search the drinking
water database for two broad categories of information: public water systems
(inventory, sampling schedules, violations and enforcement actions) and
sampling data reported for public water systems. All
search field criteria on the Search Page are “and” criteria. That
is, each field where you specify a search value should be interpreted
as further constraining the search by “and”. You
can enter search criteria anywhere on the page. The following are three
example searches:

- All water systems
   principally served by a specific county and their administrative contacts
   (specify Principal County Served and Point
   of Contact Type AC)

- All TCR Sample Results
   that showed presence of Total Coliform bacteria for a specific Water System
   within the past 2 years (specify the Water System No. and select Sample
   Class TCR Samples Detection Only

- All
   90th percentile Lead and Copper sample summaries for Community water systems
   within the past 6 years (specify Water System Type C
   and select Sample Class Lead and Copper
   Summaries and enter today's date-minus
   6 years in the Sample Collection Date Range From field and today's date in the To field.

(1) Public Water Systems

Public Water Supply Systems Search gives
you search criteria so that you may easily find one or more public water
systems. Water systems are classified according to rules developed by
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and each state.

You can enter criteria into one or more
of the following six Public Water Supply systems Search Parameters:

[Water \\
System No.](https://gadrinkingwater.net/DWWPUB/Help/html_Water_System_No.htm)

[Water \\

[Point \\
of Contact Type](https://gadrinkingwater.net/DWWPUB/Help/html_Points_of_Contact_Type.htm)

Pressing
Search for Water Systems displays the Water Systems List from which you
can select to view additional information about the water system on the
Water System Detail page including:

- Points-of-Contact

- Annual operating periods
   and population served

- Service connections

- Sources of water

- Service areas

- Water purchases

If your search includes a Point of Contact
Type, the address information for the type of point of contact you specified
is included as a column on the Water Systems List. Selecting a water system
presents you the [Water System \\
Detail](https://gadrinkingwater.net/DWWPUB/Help/html_Water_System_Details.htm) page, where you can view detailed inventory information about
the Water System. You may also click on links for sampling, scheduling,
site visit, and violation information for the water system you selected.

(2) Search for Samples

The Sample Collection Date Range fields
let you further broaden or constrain the number of sample results your
criteria retrieves. To
prevent lengthy accidental searches, the sample search default will always
return results for the most recent two years unless you explicitly enter
a wider or narrower date range. If you remove the default dates, the search
still uses the most recent two years as search criteria. To return results
from more than two years ago, you need to enter a “from” date that is
before two years ago. For example, if today’s date is June 9, 2005,

- to find samples from
   the last 5 years, you would need to enter 6/9/2000 in the “from” date
   and 6/9/2005 in the “to” date of the search date range. To find samples
   from the last month.

- to find samples from
   the last month, you would need to enter 5/10/2005 in the “from” date and
   6/9/2005 in the “to” date of the search date range. To find samples from
   the last month.

If you specify one or more Sample Search
Parameters criteria, the Search for Samples button is available.
