# **Confidential Intelligence Briefing: The Human, Political, and Technical Drivers of Georgia EPD eRFI 46200-DNR0000804**

## **Part I: The Gatekeeper: A Professional Dossier on Rhonda Henslee**

To understand the strategic landscape of this Request for Information (RFI), one must first understand the individual designated as its "Official Issuing Officer." Any proposed solution must ultimately pass through her professional filter. An in-depth analysis reveals that Rhonda Henslee is not an environmental policy expert but a career procurement specialist, a distinction that fundamentally shapes the criteria for a successful project.

### **The Procurement Professional's Mindset: Career Trajectory and Stated Priorities**

Rhonda Henslee’s professional identity is firmly rooted in the world of government administration and finance. She is consistently identified by the title "Chief Procurement Officer" or "Chief Purchasing Officer" for the Georgia Department of Natural Resources (DNR).1 Her unit is situated within the DNR's administrative and finance division, not its environmental policy or scientific branches.3

An exhaustive search for public statements, interviews, or published works reveals a professional footprint confined to purchasing and administration. There is no evidence of a public profile related to environmental science, water policy advocacy, or public health initiatives.5 This absence is as telling as any data point; it confirms her role is that of a process-and-compliance gatekeeper, not a subject-matter champion.

Consequently, proposals will be evaluated through the lens of a procurement chief. The primary questions will not be about the elegance of the data science or the passion for environmentalism. Instead, the evaluation will center on fiscal and administrative soundness: Does the proposal adhere to state purchasing regulations? Is the budget clear and justifiable? Does it present a low-risk, well-defined implementation plan? Most importantly, does it solve a stated business problem for the agency in an efficient and auditable manner? Arguments about saving the environment are secondary to arguments about providing a cost-effective solution that fulfills a public mandate.

### **What Success Looks Like: Analyzing the "GA@WORK" Testimonial for Clues**

A public testimonial from Ms. Henslee regarding "GA@WORK," a new statewide financial and procurement system, offers a rare and invaluable window into her professional values.9 This statement serves as a Rosetta Stone for understanding what she defines as a successful project.

In her praise for the new system, she highlights several key attributes:

* **Clarity and Guidance:** She appreciates that the system provides "clear guidance on what needs to be done before posting a bid or executing a contract".9  
* **Process Efficiency:** She values the ability to "streamline our processes by reducing redundancies".9  
* **Compliance and Completeness:** She emphasizes that the system "helps ensure suppliers submit all required documents".9  
* **Value Through Competition:** She connects these features to a core procurement goal, noting that they help "expand our bidder pool," which inherently drives competition and value for the state.9

For Rhonda Henslee, a successful project is an efficient project. It is administratively elegant, simplifying complex processes, clarifying ambiguity, and automating tasks. A solution for the Drinking Water Viewer that is presented as a "turnkey platform" with transparent pricing, a clear implementation timeline, and features designed to reduce the administrative burden on Environmental Protection Division (EPD) staff will resonate strongly with her stated priorities. The proposal should not only describe the public-facing portal but also detail the back-end administrative interface, emphasizing how it simplifies data management for EPD staff, automates reporting, and provides a clear audit trail—all hallmarks of good governance that a procurement chief is tasked with upholding.

## **Part II: The Cauldron of Pressure: Political and Social Drivers of the RFI**

This RFI is not a product of a routine technology refresh cycle. It is a direct and urgent response to a perfect storm of widespread public fear, high-profile legal challenges, and transformative new federal regulations. The Georgia EPD is under immense pressure, and this project represents a critical component of its strategic response.

### **The "Forever Chemical" Firestorm: Mapping Georgia's PFAS Crisis**

The central catalyst is the contamination of Georgia's drinking water with per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), dubbed "forever chemicals" for their persistence in the environment and the human body.10 These man-made compounds, used for decades in products like nonstick cookware and carpet manufacturing, are linked to a host of severe health problems, including cancer, hormonal disruption, and immune system dysfunction.10

This crisis is not abstract; it is concentrated in specific geographic hotspots that have become focal points of media attention and public outrage.

* **Northwest Georgia (Dalton, Calhoun, Rome):** This region, with its long history of carpet and textile manufacturing, is considered "ground zero" for PFAS contamination.10 Companies like Shaw Industries and Mohawk Industries have been implicated in lawsuits alleging they dumped PFAS-laced waste for decades.10 In Calhoun, contamination levels have been reported at 625% over EPA minimum reporting levels, while in nearby Dalton, levels in water and soil are allegedly thousands of times higher than legal limits.10 An Emory University study found residents in Rome and Calhoun have above-average levels of PFAS in their blood.15  
* **Augusta:** This area has registered some of the state's highest contamination readings, at a staggering 1175% over EPA minimum reporting levels.14 Specific tests in the Augusta-Richmond County water system detected PFOS, a type of PFAS, at 36.3 parts per trillion (  
  ppt), a level that has raised alarms about links to kidney and testicular cancer.16  
* **Metro Atlanta:** The crisis extends into the state's most populous region, with new testing revealing "forever chemicals" in the drinking water systems of Clayton County, Austell, and Covington.17

The political pressure is most acute where the problem is most personal. Residents in these communities feel "betrayed" by a system that failed to protect them from a "hidden threat".13 A successful digital solution must therefore provide granular, location-specific data that speaks directly to the fears of citizens in these hotspots. A generic, statewide overview will be perceived as evasive and inadequate.

### **Voices of Outrage: Community Activism, High-Stakes Lawsuits, and Media Narratives**

The public fear has been amplified and focused by legal action and high-profile activism.

* **Legal Pressure:** The Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC), on behalf of the Coosa River Basin Initiative (CRBI), filed a federal lawsuit against the City of Calhoun, alleging it allowed PFAS pollution from industrial users to contaminate the Coosawattee River and local groundwater.13 This legal action has already yielded a settlement forcing Calhoun to overhaul its wastewater pretreatment program and investigate its drinking water wells.14 A separate, major lawsuit was filed by landowners in Gwinnett County against chemical and manufacturing giants like 3M, DuPont, and major carpet producers.10  
* **High-Profile Activism:** The situation has drawn national attention through the involvement of famed environmental activist Erin Brockovich. She has partnered with local groups to host town halls in Chatsworth and Calhoun, announcing "alarming" new test results from local water, soil, and dust samples, further galvanizing the community and intensifying pressure on state officials.14  
* **Relentless Media Coverage:** State and local news outlets, including *The Atlanta Journal-Constitution*, Georgia Public Broadcasting (GPB News), and FOX 5 Atlanta, have provided sustained and critical coverage. Reports have highlighted everything from the health risks and legal battles to the potential closure of federal water monitoring centers, creating a narrative of a state struggling to manage a pervasive environmental crisis.15

### **The Federal Mandate: How New EPA Regulations Forced Georgia's Hand**

While public pressure created the political will, a new federal rule created the legal necessity for this project. On April 10, 2024, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced the first-ever National Primary Drinking Water Regulation (NPDWR), establishing legally enforceable limits for six specific PFAS chemicals.22 This action is the single most important catalyst for the RFI.

* **The Regulatory Hammer:** The new rule transforms PFAS from a concern into a legal liability. It establishes Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs) for PFOA and PFOS at an exceptionally low 4.0 ppt.22 This is a dramatic reduction from the previous non-enforceable health  
  *advisory* level of 70 ppt and is effectively the lowest level at which the chemicals can be reliably detected.14  
* **Non-Negotiable Deadlines:** The EPA rule imposes a strict and unavoidable timeline. Public water systems must complete their initial monitoring for these PFAS by 2027\. Any system that detects PFAS above the new MCLs will have until 2029 to implement solutions to reduce the contamination.21

This federal mandate creates a massive data collection, management, and public reporting burden for the EPD and every public water system in Georgia. The RFI is, therefore, a compliance tool disguised as a public information portal. The EPD needs a new platform that can not only display this complex data to a frightened public but also serve as the internal system of record for managing compliance with these stringent new federal laws. The old system is wholly inadequate for this new reality.

### **Table 1: Key PFAS Contamination Events & Hotspots in Georgia (2022-2025)**

| Location/County | Key Contaminants | Reported Levels / Detections | Primary Source (Alleged) | Key Events / Dates | Source(s) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Calhoun / Gordon County** | PFOA, PFOS | \~625% over EPA min. reporting levels; Emory study finds high levels in residents' blood. | Industrial wastewater from carpet manufacturers. | SELC lawsuit filed (Mar 2024); Lawsuit settled, forcing city action (2024); Erin Brockovich town hall (Jun 2025). | 14 |
| **Dalton / Whitfield County** | PFAS | Levels in water/soil "thousands of times higher" than EPA limit. | Carpet and chemical manufacturers (3M, DuPont, Shaw, Mohawk). | Major landowner lawsuit filed in Gwinnett County. | 10 |
| **Augusta / Richmond County** | PFOS | 1175% over EPA min. reporting levels; 36.3 ppt detected in finished water. | Industrial waste. | High contamination levels reported by USA Today/EPA data (Jun 2025). | 14 |
| **Metro Atlanta (Clayton Co., Austell, Covington)** | PFAS | "Forever chemicals" revealed in new round of testing. | Source under investigation in Clayton County. | AJC reports on new EPA testing results (Sep 2023). | 17 |
| **Statewide** | PFOA, PFOS, GenX, etc. | Widespread contamination found in surface waters. | Industrial discharge, landfills, firefighting foam. | EPA announces legally enforceable PFAS drinking water rule (Apr 2024). | 11 |

## **Part III: Technical Archaeology: A Post-Mortem of the Current Georgia Drinking Water Viewer**

The existing system, gadrinkingwater.net, is not merely outdated; it is a case study in failed public information architecture. Its design is so opaque and expert-oriented that it functions as a barrier to public understanding rather than a conduit. Its profound failures provide a clear roadmap of what to avoid and represent the core technical and communication problem the EPD must solve.

### **gadrinkingwater.net: A Portal for Insiders, Not Citizens**

The user experience of the current portal is not designed for the public. An analysis of official instructions for its use, documented by both the EPD itself and local water utilities, reveals a system built by and for regulatory insiders.25 To find a simple piece of information like lead testing results for their home, a concerned citizen must navigate a labyrinthine process:

1. Access the website gadrinkingwater.net.25  
2. Know and enter their specific, non-intuitive "Water System No." (e.g., "3110000" for the City of Cleveland).25 There is no option to search by address, city, or zip code.  
3. Navigate a sidebar of technical links to find "Chem/Rad Samples/Results by Analyte".25  
4. From a long list of chemicals, the user must know the specific numerical "Analyte Code" for the contaminant they are interested in (e.g., "1030" for Lead).25

This process effectively excludes the vast majority of the public, who possess neither their water system ID nor the EPD's internal codes for contaminants.

### **Data Obfuscation by Design**

Even if a user successfully navigates this maze, the data they receive is presented without context, explanation, or visualization. The system displays raw scientific data, such as "90th percentile sample results in mg/L".26 To a citizen asking the simple question, "Is my water safe to drink?", this information is meaningless. The portal makes no attempt to translate this data into plain language, compare it to federal or state health guidelines, or provide any visual aids to interpret the numbers. It is a data repository, not a communication tool.

The utter failure of gadrinkingwater.net as a public-facing instrument is the central justification for this RFI. It cannot answer the questions a panicked public is asking about PFAS. It is structurally incapable of managing and presenting the wave of new data mandated by the EPA. It is a compliance-reporting backend that has been miscast as a public viewer. Any new solution must be framed as its philosophical opposite: citizen-first, intuitive by design, and rich with context.

## **Part IV: The Art of the Possible: Best-in-Class Benchmarking**

To define a winning solution, it is essential to look beyond Georgia's current capabilities and analyze best-in-class examples of public-facing environmental data portals. These benchmarks establish a new standard for what is possible and provide a blueprint for a solution that is both innovative and achievable.

### **The Gold Standard for Public Empowerment: The EWG Tap Water Database**

The Environmental Working Group's (EWG) Tap Water Database is a premier example of a consumer-focused tool.28

* **Key Features:** Its brilliance lies in its simplicity and action-oriented design. The user journey begins with a simple ZIP code search, which immediately connects them to their local water utility.29 The results are not just raw numbers; contaminant levels are compared against both the EPA's legal limits and EWG's own, often stricter, health guidelines, providing a more protective view of potential risk.29 Most importantly, it answers the question, "What can I do?" by providing a "water filter guide" with personalized recommendations based on the specific contaminants found, empowering users to take immediate, tangible action.31  
* **Relevance for Georgia:** In a climate of fear and mistrust, this model directly addresses the public's desire for agency. It provides not just information, but also solutions.

### **The Map-Centric Approach: Lessons from the Texas TCEQ GIS Hub**

The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) provides a powerful example of using geographic information systems (GIS) for public communication.34

* **Key Features:** The TCEQ hub is built around a suite of interactive map viewers, including a "Surface Water Quality Viewer" and a "Wastewater Outfalls Viewer".35 This allows users to explore data visually and spatially. Instead of requiring obscure system IDs, users can search by map, water body name, or river basin, providing multiple intuitive pathways to information.36 The GIS platform allows for the layering of different data sets—such as monitoring stations, permitted discharge points, and impaired water bodies—to create a rich, contextual understanding of environmental factors in a specific area.  
* **Relevance for Georgia:** With PFAS contamination concentrated in distinct geographic hotspots like Northwest Georgia and Augusta, a map-centric portal would be incredibly effective for communicating regional risks and visualizing the EPD's monitoring and remediation efforts.

### **The Public Health Communicator: New York City's Drinking Water Quality Portal**

New York City's portal, managed by its Department of Health, excels at public health communication and trust-building.37

* **Key Features:** The portal leads with "Key Messages"—clear, concise, and reassuring summaries of water quality (e.g., "The quality of the drinking water in the NYC system is excellent.").37 It proactively explains  
  *why* certain contaminants are monitored and provides plain-language context for the results, such as noting the seasonal effects on disinfection by-products. It also offers direct, actionable health guidance, such as recommending residents run their tap before use and offering free lead testing services.37  
* **Relevance for Georgia:** The EPD's primary challenge is not just technical but also relational; it must rebuild public trust. Adopting NYC's communication-first approach—translating complex data into clear, accessible, and direct messages—would be a significant step toward managing the public relations dimension of the water quality crisis.

### **Table 2: Comparative Analysis of Best-in-Class Portal Features**

| Feature | GA Drinking Water Viewer (gadrinkingwater.net) | EWG Tap Water Database | Texas TCEQ GIS Hub | NYC Drinking Water Portal |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Search Method** | Water System ID & Analyte Code 26 | ZIP Code 31 | Interactive Map, Water Body Name 36 | Neighborhood / System-wide 37 |
| **Data Context** | None. Raw data (e.g., mg/L) presented without context.26 | Excellent. Compares results to both legal limits and stricter health guidelines.29 | Good. Data is layered spatially, providing geographic context (e.g., proximity to outfalls).35 | Excellent. Plain-language explanations of contaminants and trends.37 |
| **Risk Communication** | Non-existent. Data is incomprehensible to the public. | Strong. Clearly explains potential health risks for each contaminant detected.31 | Implicit. Risk is inferred from maps of impaired waters and monitoring stations. | Strong. Leads with "Key Messages" to reassure or inform; explains health significance.37 |
| **Actionability** | None. Provides no guidance or next steps for the user. | Excellent. Offers a personalized water filter guide based on detected contaminants.33 | Limited. Primarily an informational tool for exploration. | Good. Provides direct advice (e.g., flush tap) and offers free testing services.37 |
| **Target Audience** | Regulatory Insiders / Experts 27 | General Public / Consumers 29 | Informed Public / Researchers 36 | General Public / Residents 37 |

## **Part V: Confidential Briefing: The Secret Memo for a Winning Strategy**

### **The Underlying Narrative: A Political Problem Demanding a Technical Solution**

The Georgia Environmental Protection Division is not merely upgrading an IT system. It is navigating a full-blown crisis of public trust, fueled by the legitimate and widespread fear of PFAS contamination. The agency is caught in a vise between terrified citizens, aggressive environmental litigators, and a new, unfunded federal mandate that carries the force of law.

This RFI is a search for a silver bullet: a tool that can simultaneously placate public anger by demonstrating transparency, and provide the EPD with the robust data management system it desperately needs to comply with the 2024 EPA regulations. The current system fails on both fronts.

The ultimate decision-maker on this procurement, Rhonda Henslee, is not an environmental scientist. She is a procurement chief whose professional values, as evidenced by her public statements, are rooted in process efficiency, fiscal responsibility, risk reduction, and clear public value.9 A solution that is technically complex, administratively burdensome, or has an ambiguous return on investment will be rejected, no matter how scientifically advanced.

### **Actionable Strategic Recommendation: Framing the Project for Maximum Impact**

The core strategy must be to reframe the project's purpose. The winning response will not be a proposal for a "Drinking Water Viewer." It will be a proposal for a comprehensive **"Public Trust and Compliance Platform."** This reframing immediately elevates the solution beyond a simple website and directly addresses the dual nature of the EPD's existential problem.

This platform must be presented with a clear, dual-value proposition:

1. **For the Public & Political Leadership (The "Trust" Component):** The proposal must promise an intuitive, map-centric public portal inspired by the best features of the EWG and Texas systems. It will allow any citizen to enter their address and see clear, contextualized information about their water quality. Data will be compared against both legal EPA limits *and* more stringent public health guidelines to demonstrate full transparency. It will include plain-language explanations of contaminants and their health risks, mirroring the NYC portal's success. Crucially, it will empower users with actionable steps they can take, transforming fear into agency and beginning the long process of rebuilding public trust.  
2. **For the EPD & Rhonda Henslee (The "Compliance" Component):** The proposal must detail a secure, streamlined administrative backend designed to automate the data ingestion, management, and reporting required by the new EPA PFAS rule. It must explicitly articulate how this platform will reduce the workload for EPD staff, ensure auditable compliance with the 2027 monitoring and 2029 remediation deadlines, and provide a clear, fiscally responsible return on investment. This is achieved by solving two critical agency problems—a public relations firestorm and a federal compliance nightmare—with a single, elegant, and cost-effective solution. This approach speaks directly to Ms. Henslee's documented priorities of streamlining processes and reducing redundancies.9

By presenting a unified platform that solves both the EPD's external political crisis and its internal administrative and compliance challenge, this strategy positions the solution as the only one that truly understands the high-stakes, behind-the-scenes context of this RFI. It demonstrates not just technical competence, but strategic wisdom.
