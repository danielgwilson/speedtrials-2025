# Georgia Clear Water - PFAS Response & Water Transparency Platform PRD

**Last Updated**: June 28, 2025 - Strategic pivot based on deep research revealing PFAS crisis as central driver

## Executive Summary

This document consolidates all research, analysis, and strategic planning for Georgia's emergency response to the PFAS contamination crisis through a modern water transparency platform. "Georgia Clear Water" represents both the goal (clear, safe water) and the method (clear, transparent information).

**Critical Context**: This is NOT a routine IT upgrade. This RFI (46200-DNR0000804) is Georgia EPD's direct response to:
- PFAS contamination 625-1175% over EPA limits in multiple counties
- Active lawsuits (SELC vs. Calhoun, settled 2024)
- New federal EPA PFAS regulations (April 2024) requiring compliance by 2027
- Massive public trust crisis with media scrutiny and activist involvement (Erin Brockovich)

**Strategic Reframing**: We're positioning this as a "Public Trust and Compliance Platform" that serves dual purposes:
1. **Public Trust**: Emergency response tool for PFAS-affected communities
2. **EPD Compliance**: Automated system for meeting 2027/2029 EPA deadlines

## 1. The Crisis Context

### PFAS Contamination Hotspots Driving This RFI
| Location | PFAS Levels | Impact | Status |
|----------|-------------|---------|---------|
| **Calhoun/Gordon County** | 625% over EPA limits | SELC lawsuit, Erin Brockovich town halls | Settlement forcing city action |
| **Augusta/Richmond County** | 1,175% over EPA limits | Wells shut down, 36.3 ppt in finished water | Seeking treatment funding |
| **Dalton/Whitfield County** | "Thousands of times" over limits | Major carpet industry lawsuits | $300M+ in settlements |
| **Metro Atlanta** | Emerging detections | Clayton, Austell, Covington affected | Under investigation |

### Current System Failures During Crisis
- **Requires Obscure Codes**: Users must know "Water System ID" and "Analyte Code 1030" for lead
- **Byzantine Navigation**: Official instructions require 6+ steps through "Chem/Rad Samples/Results by Analyte"
- **Zero Mobile Support**: Unusable during emergencies when 70% access via mobile
- **No PFAS Visibility**: Cannot easily find or understand PFAS test results
- **No Context**: Shows "36.3 ppt" without explaining this exceeds new 4.0 ppt federal limit

**Crisis Impact**:
- Calhoun residents discovered decades of contamination only through lawsuits
- Augusta citizens can't track which wells are contaminated
- 300% increase in panicked calls to water hotlines
- Media narrative: "EPD hiding data behind unusable website"

### Impact
- **Public Health Risk**: Citizens can't understand if their water is safe
- **Compliance Failures**: Small water systems struggle with complex requirements
- **Regulatory Inefficiency**: Field inspectors lack mobile access to critical data
- **Trust Erosion**: Opacity breeds distrust in water safety

## 2. The Decision Maker: Understanding Rhonda Henslee

**Critical Insight**: The RFI's "Official Issuing Officer" is NOT an environmental expert but Rhonda Henslee, Chief Procurement Officer for Georgia DNR. This fundamentally shapes our approach.

### What Rhonda Values (Based on Public Statements)
From her praise of the GA@WORK system, she explicitly values:
- **"Clear guidance on what needs to be done"**
- **"Streamline our processes by reducing redundancies"**
- **"Helps ensure suppliers submit all required documents"**
- **"Expand our bidder pool"** (competition = value)

### Translation for Our Project
Rhonda will evaluate success as:
1. **Compliance**: Meets all RFI requirements to the letter
2. **Efficiency**: Reduces EPD staff workload, automates reporting
3. **Risk Mitigation**: Proven technology, clear implementation plan
4. **Budget Reality**: $100-500K range (per informal estimates)
5. **Public Value**: Visible win for the agency amid crisis

**Key Strategy**: Frame as streamlining tool that automates PFAS compliance reporting while rebuilding public trust.

## 3. Vision & Goals

### Vision Statement
"Georgia Clear Water" - Making water quality data as clear as the water should be. A dual-purpose platform that transforms crisis response into transparent public service while automating federal compliance.

### Strategic Goals
1. **PFAS Crisis Response**: Immediate visibility into contamination hotspots with plain English explanations
2. **10-Second Answers**: From address search to safety status faster than calling a hotline
3. **Automated Compliance**: Meet 2027/2029 EPA deadlines without additional staff burden
4. **Trust Through Transparency**: Show what's being tested, when, and what's being done about problems

## 3. User Personas & Needs

### Persona 1: The Public (Primary - HACKATHON FOCUS)
**Representative Users**: 
- **Sarah** (35): Mother of 2, suburban Atlanta, moderate tech skills
- **Marcus** (42): Investigative journalist, high tech skills, needs data access
- **Elena** (68): Retired teacher, rural Georgia, low tech skills

**Core Need**: "Is my water safe?" in plain English

**Detailed User Journey Pain Points**:
1. **Discovery**: Can't find site via Google (poor SEO)
2. **Access**: No address search - must know PWSID or scroll 159 counties
3. **Understanding**: Technical codes like "MCL, ACUTE (TCR)" meaningless
4. **Trust**: No indication if violations are current or resolved
5. **Action**: No guidance on what to do (boil? filter? avoid?)

**Success Metrics**:
- Find water status in <30 seconds (vs current 20+ minutes)
- 95% comprehension rate without help
- 90+ mobile usability score

### Persona 2: Water System Operators (Secondary)
**Representative User**: Mike, sole operator of rural 500-person system
- **Core Need**: "Help me avoid violations with limited resources"
- **Pain Points**: Manual compliance tracking, missed deadlines
- **Success Metric**: 50% reduction in preventable violations

**Critical User Stories**:
1. Dashboard of upcoming compliance deadlines
2. Automated sampling reminders
3. Digital report generation
4. Historical violation pattern analysis
5. Corrective action tracking

### Persona 3: Regulators (Tertiary)
**Representative User**: Jennifer, EPD field inspector
- **Core Need**: "Access system data during site visits"
- **Pain Points**: No mobile access, paper-based processes
- **Success Metric**: 75% reduction in inspection prep time

**Critical User Stories**:
1. Mobile access during site visits
2. Pattern detection for high-risk systems
3. Aggregate compliance reporting
4. Enforcement action tracking
5. Emergency response coordination

## 4. Data Architecture & Gap Analysis

### Available Data Assets
**10 CSV files with 2025Q1 Georgia SDWIS snapshot:**
- Public Water Systems (5,000+ systems)
- Violations & Enforcement (historical compliance)
- Lead & Copper Samples (contaminant measurements)
- Geographic Areas (service locations)
- Reference Codes (lookup values)
- Facilities, Site Visits, Service Areas, etc.

**Universal Primary Key**: PWSID (e.g., "GA0010000")

### Critical Data Gap - NOW RESOLVED
**Previously Missing**: Health Context Reference Data
- No Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs)
- No health effect descriptions
- No risk communication templates
- No vulnerable population warnings

**Solution Implemented**:
Created `EPA_MCL_HEALTH_EFFECTS.csv` with:
- 90+ contaminants with legal limits (MCLs)
- Plain English health effects
- Vulnerable population warnings
- Common contamination sources
- Treatment/action guidance

```csv
CONTAMINANT_NAME,MCL,HEALTH_EFFECTS,VULNERABLE_GROUPS
"Lead","TT; Action Level = 0.015 mg/L","Delays in development, learning problems","Infants, children, pregnant women"
"Arsenic","0.010 mg/L","Skin damage, circulatory problems, cancer risk","All populations"
```

- Schema focused on PFAS tracking and compliance
- Pre-loaded with hotspot data

**ORM**: 
- **Drizzle** for type-safe queries
- Lightweight, perfect for SQLite
- Better DX than Prisma for simple schemas

**Stack**:
```typescript
// Tech stack for 2.5 hour build
const stack = {
  framework: "Next.js 14 (App Router)",
  database: "SQLite (local file)",
  orm: "Drizzle ORM",
  styling: "Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui",
  maps: "Mapbox GL JS (free tier)",
  hosting: "Vercel (instant deploy)",
  search: "In-memory geocoding"
}
```

### Phase 2 Features (Post-Launch)
