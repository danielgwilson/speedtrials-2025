# Confidential Briefing: Georgia EPD Drinking Water

# Viewer RFI – Strategic Context and

# Recommendations

## 1. Stakeholder Deep Dive – Rhonda Henslee (Official Issuing Officer)

**Role and Background:** Rhonda Henslee is the Chief Procurement Officer for the Georgia Department of
Natural Resources (DNR) , heading the Purchasing unit. In this capacity, she oversees all procurement
and contracting for DNR, including the Environmental Protection Division (EPD). Her professional profile
shows deep roots in state procurement – she holds state purchasing certifications and has served in DNR’s
purchasing department for over a decade (e.g. listed as a Purchasing/Inventory Manager in 2017 public
records). Henslee is not an environmental program manager; she’s on the **procurement/finance side**
of the house. This means she is attuned to **budgets, compliance, and value for money** in any project.

**Professional Priorities:** Given her role, Henslee’s definition of success likely centers on a solution that is
**fiscally responsible, compliant with state IT standards, and delivers clear public value**. She will be
focused on:


Procurement Compliance & Risk Management: She will favor a well-documented solution that
meets the RFI requirements to the letter and minimizes implementation risk. As the issuing officer,
she must ensure the project can be delivered on time and within budget, avoiding any procurement
pitfalls.
Cost-Effectiveness: Coming from a purchasing background, Henslee will scrutinize costs. Expect her
to be impressed by solutions that maximize impact under constrained budgets , possibly by
leveraging modern, cost-efficient technologies (open-source tools, cloud services, etc.). (Notably, an
RFI budget range was informally estimated at $100K–$500K , so she knows a “gold-plated”
solution is off the table.)
Stakeholder Value and Public Impact: She is aware this project has high public visibility. A
successful project, to her, satisfies the needs of multiple stakeholders as outlined by EPD: a user-
friendly public portal, useful tools for water system operators, and mobile access for regulators.
She will look for a solution that demonstrably improves public transparency and EPD’s service to
communities. In her view, a win is a system that the agency’s leadership can hold up as a public-
facing success story (especially amid recent water safety concerns).

**What Will Resonate:** To connect with Henslee’s perspective, any presentation should **speak the language
of value and reliability**. Emphasize how the solution: 1) addresses the RFI’s core goals for the public,
operators, and regulators, 2) is built with proven tech (reducing future maintenance costs), and 3) provides
EPD a “quick win” to show to legislators and the public. For example, framing the project as **“modernizing
at minimal cost by repurposing existing data (SDWIS) into an intuitive interface”** will appeal to her
practicality. Also, given her exposure to **state finance and audits** , showing awareness of data security,
privacy, and long-term support will build confidence. In short, **Henslee will respond to a solution that is**

**efficient, accountable, and clearly beneficial to citizens** – a project that makes her agency look good
without breaking the bank.

## 2. Political & Social Context – Why the RFI, and Why Now?

This RFI did not emerge in isolation; it comes amid **mounting public pressure over drinking water safety
in Georgia.** Over the past 2–3 years, a series of water quality scares and community outcries have put EPD
and local authorities under the spotlight, creating urgency for a public-facing solution:


PFAS “Forever Chemical” Contamination: Georgia has been grappling with widespread PFAS
contamination revelations. Federal data in 2023–2024 showed 48 public water systems across the
state reporting PFAS in their water. Notably, systems in Centerville, Augusta, Griffin, and
Spalding County were found to have PFAS levels exceeding the EPA’s previous proposed limits.
This has generated significant concern. In Augusta, for example, officials shut down several
contaminated wells upon discovering multiple PFAS compounds above safe levels. PFAS is still
being detected in Augusta’s drinking water , and the city is scrambling for funding to install
advanced treatment. Such headlines underscore that even larger cities are struggling with
emerging contaminants – a fact not lost on the public. Meanwhile, northwest Georgia has seen
outcry and legal action due to PFAS linked to the carpet manufacturing industry. In Calhoun
(Gordon County), residents discovered their water supply had been tainted by decades of industrial
PFAS waste. This led to high-profile lawsuits: in 2024, the Southern Environmental Law Center sued
the City of Calhoun for allegedly allowing PFAS into drinking water, resulting in a landmark
settlement. The city agreed to overhaul its wastewater treatment and water supply systems to
curb PFAS at the source. (Local activists noted this as a major victory, forcing action where
“others would not” .) Yet Calhoun still faces a separate residents’ class-action suit claiming the
city’s land-applied sewage sludge contaminated private wells with cancer-causing levels of PFAS

. Up the road, the City of Rome had already won a $300 million settlement in 2019 from carpet
chemical manufacturers for polluting its water. In short, **“forever chemicals” have become a
hot-button issue** in Georgia, especially in the northwest region. EPD is under pressure to show it is
proactively monitoring and addressing these contaminants. A modern Drinking Water Viewer can be
a tool to **regain public trust by openly tracking such pollutants.**


Community Outrage and Media Scrutiny: Beyond PFAS, Georgia has seen other water quality
alarms prompting public anger. In various counties, residents have complained about dirty or
unsafe tap water – from discolored, foul-smelling water to violations of standards like high lead
or trihalomethanes. For instance, parts of the Augusta area and neighboring counties faced
trihalomethane (TTHM) violations , leading to public notices and Facebook chatter about health
risks. In rural south Georgia, communities like Juliette (Monroe County) made news due to
toxic elements (like arsenic from coal ash) in their well water, sparking environmental justice protests
and demands for clean water pipelines. Statewide rankings show Georgia has a relatively poor
record on drinking water violations (ranked 39th in the U.S. for health-based violations in one
analysis) , which advocacy groups seize upon. Meanwhile, local news investigations have zeroed
in on EPD’s enforcement lapses. Investigative reporters in Atlanta have run “water watchdog”
segments exposing that state regulators were slow to crack down on known polluters (e.g. the
Atlanta News First series “Poisoned Without Permission” chronicled how PFAS went unchecked in
North Georgia waterways for years). This critical media coverage fuels public perception that
regulators must do more – and do it transparently.

Political Attention: All these incidents have caught the attention of Georgia’s political leaders.
Legislators and local officials are being confronted by constituents worried about their drinking
water. The Georgia Water Coalition and other advocacy groups have been calling for stronger state
action (their 2022 “Healthy Water Future” report highlights inequities in access to clean water ).
The timing of this RFI suggests EPD needs a visible initiative in response. With new federal EPA
standards for PFAS on the horizon (the EPA just proposed strict PFAS limits and funding is
becoming available for compliance), Georgia’s EPD likely feels the need to modernize how it reports
water system data. “Why now?” Because EPD needs a public-facing win – a concrete step to show
citizens and lawmakers that it is leveraging technology to ensure transparency and accountability in
drinking water safety. An accessible, real-time Drinking Water Viewer is a way to demonstrate that
the agency is not hiding data or lagging behind, but actively empowering the public and local water
operators with information. In summary, the RFI is a response to public trust challenges : after
chemical scares and public criticism, EPD is compelled to upgrade its tools and rebuild confidence
through better information sharing.

## 3. The “Ghost of Solutions Past” – Critique of the Current Georgia

## Drinking Water Viewer

Georgia’s existing Drinking Water Viewer (the **gadrinkingwater.net DWWPUB** site) is a relic of an earlier
era – essentially a mid-2000s style interface grafted onto the Safe Drinking Water Information System
(SDWIS) database. It may have been state-of-the-art decades ago, but in 2025 it serves as a **“what not to
do” case study** in public data portals. Key failings include:


Byzantine Navigation: The current site is anything but user-friendly. Users are greeted with a text-
heavy homepage and are expected to navigate via an antiquated county map interface. For example,
official instructions for retrieving a simple lead test result require clicking on a Georgia map, selecting
the county, finding the water system ID number from a list, then clicking through multiple screens.
Once on a system page, the user must drill into a left-side menu of cryptically labeled links. To find
lead sampling data, one must know to click “Chem/Rad Samples/Results by Analyte,” then hunt for
the analyte code “1030” for lead. This is a cumbersome, unintuitive process that virtually
guarantees only trained specialists or the most determined citizens will succeed. The need to know
obscure codes and follow multi-step click paths is the antithesis of modern UX design.


Outdated Look and Feel: The design of the site appears frozen in time. It’s essentially a collection of
raw tables and basic text – no interactive graphics or maps , no dynamic search bar (aside from the
clunky map selector), and certainly no mobile-responsive design. Visually, it resembles a 1990s/
2000s database front-end, likely with minimal CSS styling. There is an absence of intuitive icons or
infographics. Users accustomed to contemporary web apps will find Georgia’s viewer archaic and
possibly frustrating. (One Reddit user, when asked about Georgia tap water, had to post the
DWWPUB link for reference, suggesting that the average person doesn’t even know this site exists
until someone shares it – and when they do arrive, they see a sterile, jargon-laden interface.)


Lack of Context or Guidance: The current Drinking Water Watch provides data in a vacuum. It will
show, for instance, that a contaminant sample measured X ppb, and whether that’s above the
regulatory limit, but it offers no explanation of what that means for health or compliance beyond
maybe a code or date. There’s no plain-language description of violations or health advisories on the

### •

main interface. A member of the public trying to interpret results (say, the difference between a Tier
1 violation and a Tier 3, or the significance of a detect level just below the MCL) is on their own. The
site doesn’t contextualize terms like “MCL” (Maximum Contaminant Level) or provide any educational
material alongside the data. In essence, it meets the bare minimum of “making data available,” but
without any interpretive layer or user education , undermining its usefulness to non-experts.


Performance and Accessibility Issues: Although not documented in the snippet above, it’s
common for these legacy state systems to suffer from slow load times and compatibility quirks. The
Georgia DWW uses old web technology that may not render well on mobile devices or for users with
disabilities. (For example, if the site relies on outdated HTML frames or non-compliant code, it may
flunk accessibility standards – though this would need verification, the very design hints at
accessibility being an afterthought.) Moreover, because it’s essentially a direct window into the state’s
SDWIS data, any downtime or lag in the underlying database could reflect on the public site. There’s
no indication of real-time updates or a robust error handling for the public interface.

In summary, Georgia’s current Drinking Water Viewer is **a cautionary tale** : it is _technically_ an online portal,
yet it fails to truly serve the public. It embodies an old-school, supply-driven approach (“here’s the data,
presented exactly as our internal database spits it out”) rather than a user-driven approach (“here’s what
you, a concerned resident, want to know about your water, in a format you can understand”). The RFI
explicitly signals the desire to leave this antiquated system behind. Our team should study this “ghost”
system to avoid repeating its mistakes: **no more cryptic interfaces, no more one-size-fits-all data dumps,
and no more ignoring the user experience.** The new solution must do the opposite – intuitive navigation
(search by system or location), modern visuals, explanatory content, and multi-platform accessibility – to
truly unlock the data for users.

## 4. Best-in-Class Benchmarking – “The Art of the Possible” in Water

## Data Portals

To envision what Georgia’s Drinking Water Viewer _should_ be, it’s instructive to look at exemplary water
quality and environmental data portals elsewhere. Below are three standout examples – each from a
different sphere (non-profit, state government, and another state’s regulatory portal) – that illustrate best-
in-class features and could inspire our solution:


EWG’s Tap Water Database (Nationwide, Non-Profit) – Empowering the Public
Link: EWG Tap Water Database – Environmental Working Group
Why it’s effective: EWG’s interactive database is often hailed as the gold standard for putting
drinking water information in the hands of consumers. It aggregates test data for utilities across the
country (including Georgia) and presents it in a highly accessible format. Users can simply
enter their zip code or select their utility from a list – no arcane knowledge needed – and get a clear
report on what’s in their water. Critically, EWG goes beyond the raw numbers: for each contaminant
detected, it shows the level, the federal legal limit, and EWG’s own health guideline , often based on the
latest science which can be more stringent than EPA standards. This lets users instantly see, for
example , that a contaminant is present at 5 ppb, below EPA’s 10 ppb limit, but above EWG’s health
recommendation of 1 ppb. Such context is invaluable for the layperson. The site also provides
simple health impact descriptions (“linked to cancer” etc.) in plain language. Visually, EWG’s site uses
charts and color-coding to flag issues (e.g. a bar chart showing a utility’s contaminant level as a red

bar exceeding a health guideline) – far more engaging than static tables. They even rank
contaminants by prevalence: the Georgia state page, for instance, lists contaminants found above
health guidelines across the state and how many utilities are affected. This turns data into a
story – you immediately grasp which pollutants are common problems in Georgia (like
trihalomethanes, detected in hundreds of systems above health guidelines , or specific PFAS
chemicals present in dozens of utilities ). Another user-centric feature is the filter guide : after
scaring you about contaminants, EWG helps by suggesting water filter types that can address them

. Overall, the Tap Water Database is **interactive, educational, and action-oriented**. It shows
that a portal can be scientifically rigorous yet _not_ overwhelming – a balance achieved by good UI
design and explanatory content. Our takeaway: **present data with context and allow easy search
by location** , as this dramatically lowers the barrier for public use.


Oregon’s “Drinking Water Data Online” (State Portal) – Modern, Map-Centric, and Comprehensive
Link: Oregon Drinking Water Services – Data Online – Oregon Health Authority
Why it’s effective: Oregon’s state drinking water portal is a great example of a government site that
feels up-to-date. Right from the start, it offers multiple intuitive search options : users can type an
address or water system name into an interactive map, or browse by clicking on the map, which
instantly shows water systems in that area. This GIS-based approach means a citizen who
doesn’t know their system ID can simply zoom into their town and click – a pop-up will show the
system name, basic info, and provide a direct link to detailed reports. This is a stark
improvement over Georgia’s county-list method. The Oregon portal is also mobile-responsive and
user-friendly, having been built in recent years; it’s designed to be used in the field by regulators on
tablets, as well as by the public at home. Once a user selects a system, the amount of information
available is impressive: test results, violations, contacts, treatment details, and more, all organized
under clean tabs or sections. Importantly, Oregon didn’t stop at just regurgitating data; they added
features to address current water concerns. For example, their portal has dedicated pages for
emerging issues like PFAS contamination, cyanotoxins from algal blooms, and even post-wildfire volatile
organic compounds. These are listed right on the main page navigation for quick access. By
surfacing such topics, Oregon makes it easy for the public or local officials to see if their systems
have had any PFAS detections, for instance, and what the response was. They also highlight “Alerts”
and “Public Notices” in the interface , ensuring that if a boil-water notice or other advisory is in
effect, users can’t miss it. Oregon’s site proves that a state agency can present comprehensive
regulatory data in a navigable, even inviting way. Key inspirations here are the map-driven
search , the breadth of information (not just compliance data but also contextual info like system
surveys and deficiencies), and the focus on current concerns (making the site timely and relevant).
Essentially, it’s SDWIS data with a facelift and brains – exactly what Georgia needs to emulate.

California’s Human Right to Water Portal (Regulatory Transparency) – Interactive and
Accountability-Focused
Link: CA Human Right to Water Portal – CA State Water Resources Control Board
Why it’s effective: California took a slightly different approach, framing their drinking water data
portal around the “Human Right to Water” initiative. Launched in 2017, this portal is explicitly
designed to hold the state accountable for providing safe drinking water to all communities. Its
features are oriented towards concerned citizens, reporters, or policymakers who want to track
which systems are failing and why. A core feature is an interactive state map highlighting every
public water system that is out of compliance with health standards. At a glance, one can
see clusters of red dots where systems have ongoing violations (common issues included nitrate contamination in agricultural areas, arsenic in desert communities, etc.). Users can click on those systems to get detailed info on the contaminant exceedances and compliance history. What sets
California’s portal apart is how it doesn’t just name-and-shame the failing systems – it also provides
context on what’s being done. The site includes information on state efforts to assist troubled
systems (for example, noting if a small system is consolidating with a larger one to solve an issue)
and tracks progress toward compliance. In statements about the portal, officials emphasized
that the public can see not only which contaminants are a problem, but also “what they are
doing to return to compliance.” This narrative approach (problem -> response -> resolution
status) keeps the focus on solutions and accountability. Additionally, the HR2W portal has
educational resources explaining the broader initiative, funding programs, and even success stories
of systems that overcame contamination. It’s a great example of a data portal doubling as a
communication tool : it tells a story that “we know where the problems are, and here’s how we’re
fixing them” – thereby maintaining public trust. The design is user-friendly with simple search
functions, and the data is updated frequently (monthly, for compliance status). The key inspiration
from California is the marriage of data with narrative and policy context. For Georgia, which
faces its own environmental justice issues (e.g. rural systems with chronic problems), a similar
approach of highlighting problem areas and showing EPD’s response could be powerful. We can take
cues in presenting compliance data alongside an actionable “path forward,” rather than just static
reports.

**In summary,** these benchmarks teach us several crucial lessons: an ideal drinking water portal should be
**accessible** (simple search and navigation for all users), **informative** (raw data plus explanations, health
context, and guidance), **interactive** (maps, visualizations, alerts), and **responsive to current issues** (e.g.
featuring emerging contaminants and equity considerations). By channeling the best elements of EWG’s
usability and educational tilt, Oregon’s breadth and modern UI, and California’s accountability and narrative
framing, Georgia EPD’s new viewer can leapfrog from worst-in-class to best-in-class. The technology and
examples are out there – it’s our job to incorporate those innovations to serve Georgia’s needs.

## 5. Executive Synthesis – “The Secret Memo” to Guide Our Strategy

**Summary Narrative:** The Georgia Environmental Protection Division (EPD) is at a crossroads, facing intense
public and political pressure to prove that **drinking water is safe** and that the agency is responsive. Over
the past few years, high-profile contamination events – particularly the discovery of **PFAS “forever
chemicals” in multiple water systems** – have eroded public trust. In North Georgia, communities like
**Calhoun** were shocked to learn their water had been polluted for years by unregulated toxins, prompting
lawsuits and multimillion-dollar settlements. In cities like **Augusta** , utilities are scrambling to
address PFAS in the water supply, taking contaminated wells offline and still detecting chemicals as they
seek funds for better treatment. And across the state, from rural counties to Atlanta’s suburbs, citizens
have grown more vocal about what’s coming out of their taps – whether it’s discolored water, boil
advisories, or confusing water quality reports. **EPD’s leadership knows they need a public-facing win,
and they need it fast.**

Enter the Drinking Water Viewer RFI (46200-DNR0000804). This project is EPD’s chance to _flip the script_ and
show proactive transparency. It’s not just a software update; it’s a **public trust-building exercise.** The goal
is to replace the outdated, cryptic water data site (which has justly been criticized as a product of a bygone
era) with a modern platform that **puts information and insight into users’ hands**. The RFI explicitly calls
for a solution serving three audiences – the public, water system operators, and regulators – reflecting a


narrative of inclusivity and broad impact. In plainer terms, EPD wants a tool that a concerned parent, a
small-town water plant manager, and an EPD field inspector could all use in their own way.

It’s important to recognize **who is steering this effort internally**. The Official Issuing Officer, **Rhonda
Henslee** , is the DNR’s Chief of Purchasing – a seasoned procurement professional. Her involvement
signals that this initiative is being closely managed for accountability and feasibility. Henslee is not a
scientist; she’s essentially the project’s gatekeeper for budget and deliverables. To her, a “successful project”
is one that **meets the business objectives, stays within budget, and causes no headaches**. She will be
looking for a solution that checks all the RFI boxes (integration with SDWIS, role-based user access,
compliance tracking, etc.) and does so in a way that is cost-effective and reliable. Given her background,
she’ll favor a pragmatic approach: leverage existing data streams, use proven technology, and avoid
unnecessary complexity. If we show that our solution can deliver the core functionality (public data portal +
operator dashboard + staff mobile access) **without a massive price tag or risk** , we speak directly to her
priorities.

At the same time, we cannot ignore the **broader political context** influencing this project. EPD’s director
and the state leadership will support this effort only insofar as it visibly addresses the outcry they’ve been
hearing. That means the end product should **visually and functionally demonstrate a new era of
transparency**. Picture a press release in a few months: “EPD Launches New Online Drinking Water
Dashboard Amid Push for Safer Water.” For that to ring true, the tool needs to be genuinely user-friendly
and responsive to current concerns. It should, for example, allow a resident in a affected community (say, a
homeowner in a NW Georgia county worried about PFAS) to easily look up their water system and see
contaminant test results _and_ what’s being done about any issues. It should allow a reporter to quickly
identify which systems in Georgia have violations or are under consent orders, etc., with data updated in
real-time. In essence, the system must serve as a **public accountability instrument**.

On the technical side, EPD is seeking a solution that brings them up to par with – if not ahead of – other
states. Georgia doesn’t want to be the laggard with a clunky website when comparisons will be made. We’ve
researched best-in-class examples: from the **EWG database** that shows how to simplify complex data for
public consumption, to states like **Oregon** and **California** that have pioneered interactivity and narrative in
their water portals. We should use these as **proof points** in our proposal. We can confidentially say to EPD,
_“We’ve seen what’s out there – and we will bring those best features to Georgia.”_ This will resonate because it
implies lower risk (we’re not proposing untested ideas; we’re adapting successes from elsewhere) and high
reward (Georgia’s portal could quickly leap to the forefront nationally, something that would reflect well on
EPD’s leadership).

Finally, let’s talk strategy: to win this (and to truly help the public), we must frame our hackathon project in a
way that aligns with these realities. We need to convince Rhonda Henslee and EPD that our solution is the
**right fit at the right time**.

**Strategic Recommendation:Position our project as the** **_turn-key public transparency win_** **that the
Georgia EPD is desperately seeking – a solution that directly addresses recent water safety
controversies with visible, user-friendly data tools, while satisfying the procurement chief’s mandate
for practicality and cost-efficiency.** In practice, this means our presentation should lead with how our
viewer will **rebuild public trust** (through features like easy search, maps, alerts for contaminants like PFAS,
and explanatory health info), and follow up with how it’s built smartly and leanly (using open data, cloud
integrations with SDWIS, modular design for future updates – giving Henslee confidence it can be delivered


1


on budget). We should explicitly reference the high-profile incidents (e.g. _“In light of the PFAS scares in
communities like Calhoun and Augusta, our tool will highlight contaminant alerts and corrective actions – turning
data that’s currently buried in PDFs into information citizens can actually use”_ ) and show screenshots or mock-
ups to make it real. At the same time, we’ll outline the architecture in a way that checks all the RFI’s technical
boxes, demonstrating we’ve essentially **answered the RFI for them**. By framing it this way, we cast our
project as timely, relevant, and responsible. It becomes not just a hackathon demo, but a prototype of
exactly what EPD would be proud to roll out: a modern Drinking Water Viewer that pacifies political pressure
and makes Rhonda Henslee’s procurement a shining example of innovation with accountability. In short, **we
give EPD a solution that is as politically smart as it is technically savvy – delivering immediate public
impact without sacrificing fiscal prudence**.
